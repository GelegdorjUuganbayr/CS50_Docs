# File Pointers
- The file manipulation functions are in <stdio.h>
- All of them accept FILE* as one of their parameters, which is used to get a file pointer in the first place. (except fopen())

### Most common file input/output (I/O) functions.
```
fopen()
fclose()
fgetc()
fputc()
fread()
fwrite()
```
