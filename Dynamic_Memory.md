# Dynamic Memory Allocation
- We can use pointers to get access to a block of **dynamically allocated memory** at runtime.
- Dynamically allocated memory comes from a pool of memory known as the **heap.**
- Prior to this point, most of memory you've been working with has comming from the memory **stack**.
