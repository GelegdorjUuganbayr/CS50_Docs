# Stream
C++ defines a standard iostream library, which allows you to input and output data to the console using << operator and >> operator.
- cin is an instance of the istream class, and allows you to perform input from the stdin device.
- cout is an instance of the ostream class, and allows you to perform output to the stdout device. 
- cerr is another instance of the ostream class, and allows you to perform output to the stderr device. 

### String
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
â€¦
std::string s;
std::cin >> s;
std::cout << "Your string is " << s << std::endl;

std::getline(std::cin, name);
```
- Note that the >> operator inputs a single word
- It stops at the first whitespace character.
- If you want to input an entire line of text, you should use the std::getline() function instead.
  - parameter1: The input stream, from which you want to get the input
  - parameter2: The std::string object, into which you want to store the value
  
### istream for a class
```cpp
 class point
{
public:
    int x, y;

    // Plus other members, as appropriate.
};

// Defining a custom operator>>
std::istream & operator>> (std::istream & is, point & p)
{
    is >> p.x >> p.y;
    return is;
}
```
- The function must be named operator >>
  - This is an example of operator overloading
- The function must receive two parameters.
  - std::istream reference, and represents the input stream from which the values will be obtained
  - a point reference here, and represents the object that will be populated with input from the stream
- The function must return a std::istream object by reference

### ostream for a class
```cpp
std::ostream & operator << (std::ostream & os, const point & p)
{
    os << "[" << p.x << "," << p.y << "]";
    return os;
}
```
- The function must be named operator <<
- The function must receive two parameters
  - std::ostream reference, and represents the output stream where values will be output
  - const point reference here, and represents the object that will be output to the stream
- The function must return a std::ostream object by reference.

## Manipulator
**std::endl**
- output an end-of-line character:

**std::flush**
- flush its internal buffer to the physical device immediately
- This is useful if you are displaying debugging information, because it ensures your debug message is displayed immediately 
  - (e.g. before the program might crash later on)

### #include \<iomanip\>
Necessary for parameterized manipulators.
6 is significant default format

**std::cout << std::setw(n)**
- Setting the field width n
- Does not cause truncation

**std::cout << std::left**
- left-justified

**std::cout << std::right**
- right-justified

**std::cout << std::fixed**
- Always displays a number, a decimal point, and a fraction part. For examle, it never uses scientific format such as 1.23e5

**std::cout << std::scientific**
- Always uses scientific format such as 1.23e5

**std::cout.unsetf(std::ios::fixed | std::ios::scientific);**
- re-establish the general formatting
  
**std::cout << std::setprecision(n)**
- set precision as 4

**std::cout << std::showpos;**\
**std::cout << std::noshowpos;**
- specify whether you want the + sign to be displayed alongside positive numbers.

**std::cout << std::dec**
- numbers should be formatted in decimal

**std::cout << std::oct**
- numbers should be formatted inoctal

**std::cout << std::hex**
- numbers should be formatted inhexadecimal

**std::cout << std::showbase**
- it causes the number base to be displayed alongside numbers
  - a leading 0 for octal numbers, and a leading 0x for hexadecimal numbers

# Reference Counted Strings
Strings have traditionally been implemented as reference counted objects as it would allow fast copy and assignment operation when their internal pointers just have to be moved to existing memory which means no memory allocation/deallocation.
- The current most popular way of implementing strings is the use of small string optimisation technique. This is done by representing small strings as buffers that are stored entirely within the string object and not allocated on the heap.

```cpp
class SSOString : public refCounter {

public:

	SSOString() : strBeg(NULL) {}

	SSOString(const char* strptr) : strSize(strlen(strptr)) {
		if (strSize < 16) {
			//< 16 chars store in array.
			memcpy(&str[0], strptr, strSize + 1);
			strBeg = NULL;
		}
		else {
			//> 16 chars alloctae on heap.
			strBeg = new char[strSize + 1];
			memcpy(strBeg, strptr, strSize + 1);
		}
	}

	char* begin() {
		return strSize < 16 ? &str[0] : strBeg; 
	}

	char* end() {
		return begin() + strSize;
	}

	unsigned length() const { 
		return strSize;
	}


	~SSOString() {
		if (strBeg) {
			delete[] strBeg;
		}
	}

private:
	unsigned strSize;
	char* strBeg;
	char str[16];
};
```
- The SSOString class above inherits from the refCounter class we created before for reference counting.
- It defines a default constructor and a constructor that has a char pointer as a parameter.
- This constructor checks the length of the char pointer and then copies it to the private char array member or copies the pointer to the private char pointer depending on whether it is less than 16 characters or not. 
- It also defines a begin(), end() and length() function that returns the private members of the char pointer or the char array or the int size.
- It also has a destructor which deletes the private char pointer if it has been allocated in the constructor. The main function to use this is

### main
```cpp
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

	//Create referenced object.
	ReferencedObject< SSOString > ref(new SSOString("Hello World!!")); //13 chars
	ReferencedObject< SSOString > ref16(new SSOString("This string is over 16 characters long so allocated on Heap")); //13 chars

	//Invocation access
	cout << "ref value is " << ref->begin() << " with size " << ref->length() << "\n\n";
	cout << "ref16 value is " << ref16->begin() << " with size " << ref16->length() << "\n\n";

	ReferencedObject< SSOString > refCopy(new SSOString());  // = ref;  // (new SSOString("Hello World!!")); //13 chars
	refCopy = ref;

	ReferencedObject< SSOString > ref16Copy(new SSOString());  // = ref16;
	ref16Copy = ref16;

	cout << "refCopy value is " << refCopy->begin() << "\n\n";
	cout << "ref16Copy value is " << ref16Copy->begin() << "\n\n";

	return 0;

}  
```
