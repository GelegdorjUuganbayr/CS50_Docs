### cd

To go to a directory, use **[cd]**. This command is case sensitive, so you have to type in the name of the folder exactly as it is.
In case directory name is **Raspberry Pi**, you need to type **cd Raspberry\\ Pi**.\
To go to home directory, you just need to type **cd**.\
To go back from a folder to the folder before that, you can type **cd ..**. The two dots represet back.
