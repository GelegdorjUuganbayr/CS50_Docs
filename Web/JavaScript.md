# Java Script
## Including the JavaScript in HTML
- Write the JavaScript between <script> tags (Like <style> of CSS)
- You can write JavaScript in separate files and link in by using the src attribute of <script> tag.

## variable
Similar to Python variables
- No type specifier
- Declare local variable: **var** keyword
```javascript
var x = 44;
let i = 0;
```
- Variable does not have strict data type

## Conditionals - if else statement
```javascript
if (x < y)
{
  ...
}
else if (x > y)
{
  ...
}
else
{
  ...
}
```

## Loop
### do while loop
```javascript
do
{
  ...
}
while(true);
```
### for loop
```javascript
for (let value of array)
{
  ...
}
```
- Iterate value in an array

## function
- All functions are introduced with the function keyword
- JavaScript functions can be anonymous - Don't have to give them a name
```javascript
function(bar, baz)
{
  ...
}
```

## array
- elements type can be mixed
- array can be resized (shirink, expand)
  - array.size(), array.pop(), array.push(x), array.shift()
```javascript
let numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];
var numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];
var mixed = [1, true, 3.333, 'five'];
```

## object (dictionary)
- C structure contain a number of fields or members (properties)
  - properties themselves can not stand on their own
  - object.attribute
- Objects have methods that are only inherent to the object
  -object.method()
```javascript
let quote = {
  name: "Netflix, Inc.",
  price: 199.32,
  symbol: "NFLX"
};
```

## Looping a object
### Printing a key
```javascript
var wkArray = ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun'];

for (var day in wkArray)
{
   console.log(day);
   console.log(wkArray[day] + ' is day number '
              + (parseInt(day) + 1) + ' of the week!');
}
```
### Result
```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

### Printing a value
```javascript
for (var day of wkArray)
{
   console.log(day);
}
```
### Result
```
Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun
```

## map()
Apply a function to all elements of an array
```javascript
var nums = [1,2,3,4,5];

nums = nums.map(function(num))
{
  return num * 2;
}
```

## Events
- event in HTML/JavaScript is a response to user interaction with the web page.
  - user clicks a button, finishing loading a page, user has hovered over a portion of the page, user typed in an input field.
- event handlers: call back functions that respond to HTML events
  - Many HTML elements have support for events as an attribute

### HTML
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Event Handlers</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <button onclick="alertName(event)">Button 1</button>
        <button onclick="alertName(event)">Button 2</button>
    </body>
</html>
```
- **onclick=""**: event handler
- Either button 1 or button 2 is clicked, alertName function will be called and event will be passed in
- Event is automatically generated by page and contains every information just happend

### JavaScript
```javascript
function alertName(event)
{
  var trigger = event.srcElement;
  alert('You clicked on ' + trigger.innerHTML);
}
```
- event.srcElement
  - what is the element on the page that is interacting with the trigger this event
  - what element affectively was passed in to this function
- innerHTML
  - which button you clicked on
