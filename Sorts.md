## Computational Complexity
- O: Worst-case scenario
- Î©: Best-case scenario
- f(n): Measurement of algorithm
We can measure an algorithm based on how it handles these inputs. We don't actually care about what f(n) is precisely, but care only about its **tendency**, which is dictated by its higtest-order term.\
